                Easter changes every year because it follows the lunar calendar. It's based on the first Sunday after the first full moon that comes after the Spring Equinox (around March 21st). So depending on the moon, Easter can be anywhere between March 22nd and April 25th!

                The earliest Easter can ever happen is March 22nd, and the latest it can fall is April 25th. This is all because of how Easter's date is tied to the moon and the equinox!

                Yes! The Easter Bunny is a busy hopper, so he starts his journey the day before Easter Sunday to make sure every basket is filled by morning. For 2025, he'll start on April 19th‚Äîmake sure you're ready to track him!

                Not exactly! Most people celebrate Easter on the same day, but some churches, like those following the Eastern Orthodox calendar, might have a different date, known as Orthodox Easter. Their Easter is based on a slightly different formula tied to the Julian calendar, not the Gregorian one most of us use.

                The Bunny finishes his journey about 25 hours later, visiting French Polynesia and the Pitcairn Islands last. His final stop is in Adamstown, Pitcairn Islands, 5 minutes before he delivers baskets to Hanga Roa, Easter Island (and others in Easter Island), 5 minutes before returning home at the Workshop.

                Unfortunately, it's impossible for the Easter Bunny to visit every city on Earth. He skips some larger cities near others, while making plenty of stops in smaller or remote towns. Even if your city isn't marked, don't worry‚Äîevery home still gets baskets! If nearby cities have basket (not carrot) icons, the Easter Bunny has likely been to your home, too.

                The Easter Bunny's age is a bit of a mystery! Since he's magical, he doesn't really age the same way humans do. Some stories say he's been around for hundreds of years, while others claim he was around even before Easter traditions started. In any case, he's timeless! The Easter Bunny is a symbol of renewal and spring, always keeping up with the times while spreading joy wherever he goes.

                The Easter Bunny lives in his magical workshop hidden on Easter Island, a remote place in the Pacific Ocean. This workshop is where the Bunny's helpers prepare all the baskets and eggs, ensuring that everything is ready for his worldwide journey. The Easter Bunny's home is filled with vibrant colors, bouncy environments, and a huge team of magical creatures who assist him in making sure the delivery process goes smoothly. Some people even say he has a secret tunnel system that leads directly to the homes of children around the world!

                Absolutely! The Easter Bunny has a whole team of magical helpers who assist with making and preparing the Easter baskets, painting eggs, and organizing the deliveries. Some of these helpers are other magical creatures, like elves or fairy-like beings, and others are enchanted animals that live on Easter Island. Each helper has a special role in the Bunny's operation. From painting eggs to coordinating the global delivery routes, the Easter Bunny's helpers make sure everything is ready for his big journey.

                The Easter Bunny travels at supernatural speeds! Thanks to his magical powers and the use of high-tech, enchanted sleighs, he can travel faster than the speed of light. On his journey, the Bunny can shift time, crossing continents and oceans in mere seconds. While he uses traditional modes of transportation, like hopping and flying, his magic allows him to warp through time zones and make his deliveries in just 25 hours. Some people say the Bunny's speed is so fast, it seems like he can be in multiple places at once! The trick is all about using magic to manipulate time and space so that he can keep up with his tight schedule.

                The Easter Bunny can travel at incredibly high speeds, far faster than any vehicle or airplane. In urban areas, the Bunny can zip around at speeds of about 750 mph (1200 km/h), but when he's flying across the ocean or traveling through less populated areas, he can reach 40,000 mph (64,000 km/h) or even faster! This means he can easily make stops in cities and remote locations all over the world in just 25 hours. His magical speed is key to completing his global mission on time, delivering Easter baskets to every child, no matter how far away they are.

                We highly recommend against trying to catch the Easter Bunny! He's incredibly fast and elusive, and if you try to catch him, you may accidentally scare him off and miss your Easter basket entirely! The Easter Bunny has a lot of work to do, and he doesn't like being interrupted. Plus, the magic that allows him to deliver baskets is sensitive, and trying to catch him might interfere with his abilities. It's best to just enjoy the fun and let the Easter Bunny do his magic without being caught. Remember, it's all about the spirit of Easter surprise!

So, leaving a fresh carrot or two out for the Easter Bunny is a kind and thoughtful gesture. He'll appreciate it as he makes his rounds!

No, the Easter Bunny doesn't just deliver to Earth! While he spends almost all of his time hopping around the globe to bring joy to homes on Earth, he also makes a magical stop at the International Space Station (ISS). At a special moment during his journey, the Easter Bunny uses his Easter-powered jetpack to travel from Earth into space. He makes a brief stop at the ISS to deliver Easter baskets and eggs to the astronauts aboard, ensuring that even those high above the Earth get a special Easter treat. After his delivery, the Easter Bunny quickly returns to Earth, thanks to his trusty jetpack, and continues his journey around the world.

                Orthodox Easter is a Christian holiday celebrated by Orthodox Christian churches, which includes the Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox churches. It usually falls on a different date than Western Christian Easter because the Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar. Orthodox Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, just like Western Easter, but it's observed with different traditions, dates, and customs.

                Yes, it is known that the Easter Bunny makes a second run around the world for Orthodox Easter! While most people celebrate Easter on the Western Christian date, the Easter Bunny also makes sure to deliver baskets to the children celebrating Orthodox Easter, hopping across the world once more to spread joy and Easter goodies. So, no worries ‚Äì you'll get another chance to track him!

                Unfortunately, the Orthodox Easter Bunny Tracker from track.easterbunny.cc (track.orthodoxbunny.cc) was shut down after Easter 2023. Currently, we aren't aware of any other websites specifically dedicated to tracking the Easter Bunny's Orthodox Easter run. However, we might be creating one for Easter 2026, so keep an eye out! For this year, we're focused on just one Bunny Tracker for Easter 2025, but who knows? We may have an Orthodox Easter Tracker in the future!

                The tracker uses Google Fonts API to load the fonts, which gives the site its clean and modern look. However, if you notice any weird fonts or the text seems off, it could be due to your browser or network blocking fonts.googleapis.com. To fix this, make sure that the domain is unblocked in your browser or network settings. If you use a DNS blocker like Pi-hole, make sure this service isn't blocking font resources either. If it isn't blocked, try refreshing the page. Once that's fixed, the fonts should load correctly!

                At the moment, the tracker is only available in English, and there aren't any immediate plans for additional language support. However, if you're comfortable with a browser translation feature, we recommend using that for a translated version of the tracker. Just be aware that automatic translations might not provide the best tracking experience and some elements may not translate perfectly, but it will help if you need it!

                Yes, Santa and the Easter Bunny are actually great friends! They share the same mission of spreading joy and gifts around the world, though their methods and timing are different. Santa delivers presents on Christmas Eve, while the Easter Bunny hops around on Easter Eve. Despite their busy schedules, they often cross paths and enjoy a little chat about their respective journeys. It's said that they even exchange tips on how to deliver gifts efficiently!
