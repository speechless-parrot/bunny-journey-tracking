    <p>The Easter Bunny&#39;s Journey Tracker just got an upgrade to v1.1, and we&#39;ve added some cool new features! Here&#39;s what&#39;s new:</p>

<br>

    <h3>🕰️ Current local time display</h3>
    <p>Now, in the additional stats box, you&#39;ll see the current local time of wherever the Easter Bunny is right now. (✨ Fun fact: The globe emoji next to it now dynamically updates to match the sector of the Easter Bunny&#39;s current timezone. Pretty neat, right?)</p>

    <br>

    <h3>🛰️ ISS stop on the map</h3>
    <p>Did you know the Easter Bunny stops at the International Space Station too? Well, now it&#39;s easier to spot! The ISS stop on the map has a special satellite icon 🛰️ so you can easily recognize it. As we get closer to Easter Eve, we&#39;ll also update the location to show the correct position of the space station!</p>

    <br>

    <h3>📶 Offline tracking???</h3>
    <p>The biggest change—now the tracker works without an internet connection! That&#39;s right, even without Wi-Fi, you can still follow the Easter Bunny&#39;s journey. How? 🤔 Using advanced algorithms, the tracker predicts the Bunny&#39;s location based on his route and past places he visited. The experience is almost identical to the online version, though there are a couple of differences. Map tiles might not load properly sometimes, and the weather &amp; Wikipedia overview features won&#39;t be available offline. But other than that, you can still keep track of the Bunny&#39;s adventure wherever you are!</p>

    <br>

    <p>So, check out the new features and enjoy the enhanced experience! 🐰🎉</p>

<p>Welcome to the new <strong>Easter Bunny&#39;s Journey tracking</strong> site—we’re so excited to have you join us for the most magical Easter experience ever! 🎉✨ This year, we’re bringing you a brand-new tracker that’s powered by real-time satellite imagery 🛰️ and a sprinkle of Easter magic 🪄 to make following the Easter Bunny’s journey more fun than ever before. And guess what? The tracker is already <strong>LIVE</strong> and ready to go!  </p>
<p>Here’s how it works:  </p>
    <br>

<ul>
<li>The Easter Bunny starts his big day on <strong>April 19th</strong> at his secret home base on <strong>Easter Island</strong> 🏝️. That’s where he makes his final preparations before taking off to deliver baskets filled with goodies around the world!</li>
</ul>
    <br>

<p>⏰ Here’s when pre-tracking starts:  </p>
    <br>

<ul>
<li>🇺🇸 <strong>New York:</strong> 3:30 AM  </li>
<li>🇦🇺 <strong>Sydney:</strong> 7:30 PM  </li>
<li>🇯🇵 <strong>Tokyo:</strong> 5:30 PM  </li>
<li>🇬🇧 <strong>London:</strong> 9:30 AM  </li>
</ul>
    <br>

<p>For the first <strong>1.5 hours</strong>, during pre-tracking, we’ll be sharing updates every <strong>2.5 minutes</strong> straight from Easter Island. You’ll get a sneak peek at what the Bunny’s up to—think of it as your exclusive backstage pass to Easter magic! 🎟️🐰  </p>
<p>🚀 <strong>When does the Bunny lift off?</strong><br>After pre-tracking, the Easter Bunny officially begins his worldwide adventure! 🌍 This is when the real fun starts—we’ll track his journey in <strong>real time</strong> so you’ll always know exactly where he is 🗺️, how many baskets he’s delivered 🎁, even how many carrots he’s eaten 🥕 along the way, and more!  </p>
<p>The Bunny will be working hard all through Easter Eve and some of Easter Day before returning to Easter Island on <strong>April 20th</strong> at these times:  </p>
    <br>
<ul>
<li>🇺🇸 <strong>New York:</strong> 6:10 AM  </li>
<li>🇦🇺 <strong>Sydney:</strong> 10:10 PM  </li>
<li>🇯🇵 <strong>Tokyo:</strong> 8:10 PM  </li>
<li>🇬🇧 <strong>London:</strong> 12:10 PM  </li>
</ul>
    <br>

<p>But the fun doesn’t stop there! Once the Bunny completes his journey, the tracker stays open year-round. You’ll be able to explore his entire route 🗺️, see all the cities he visited 🏙️, check how many baskets he delivered 🧺, how many carrots he munched on 🥕, and even how far he traveled 🐇. Oh, and the countdown will reset a week later, so we can start getting ready for <strong>Easter 2026</strong>! 🎉  </p>
    <br>

<p>While we wait for liftoff (just <strong>80 days to go</strong>!), there are some things you can do on the website to get into the Easter spirit:  </p>
    <br>

<ul>
<li>⏰ <strong>Countdown to Liftoff:</strong> Click the clock icon 🕒 at the top right of the tracker to see a full-screen countdown!  </li>
<li>🌍 <strong>Explore the Map:</strong> Unlock the Bunny’s route in advance by clicking the lock icon 🔓 at the top right. You can explore freely all the places he’ll visit!  </li>
<li>💬 <strong>Chat with the Easter Bunny:</strong> Check out our fun <a href="chat.html">Chat with the Easter Bunny</a> page to get into the Easter mood early. Who knows? Maybe he’ll share some secrets! 🤫  </li>
</ul>
    <br>

<p><strong>Here are some tips for tracking day to make the most of your experience:</strong>  </p>
<p>🔄 <strong>No need to refresh!</strong> The tracker updates every second automatically. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the magic! ✨<br>🔍 <strong>Zoom smartly:</strong> You can zoom in or out on the tracking map, even while centered on the Easter Bunny! Just remember: don’t zoom too far or it will be constantly loading in map tiles and you&#39;ll have a poor experience.<br>⚙️ <strong>Set it up beforehand:</strong> Customize your tracker settings before liftoff so everything is perfect. Your settings are saved automatically on your device, but they won’t sync between different devices or browsers. Pro tip: Set them up the same way on all your devices for the best experience! 📱💻  </p>
<p>We can’t wait to share this amazing Easter adventure with you! 💖 From the first hop 🐾 to the last carrot 🥕, you’ll be right there alongside the Easter Bunny as he spreads joy around the globe 🌐.  </p>
    <br>
<p>Let the countdown begin, friends! 🕒🐰 Get ready for an unforgettable Easter Eve ✨</p>
